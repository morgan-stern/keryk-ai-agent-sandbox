# Agent Response Formatting Guide

## Problem
Agent responses like the Duke Energy overtime rules are displaying as plain text without proper formatting, making them hard to read.

## Solution
I've created formatting utilities and components to properly display agent responses with:

1. **Numbered Lists** - Properly formatted with indentation
2. **Bold Text** - **Bold text** renders with proper emphasis
3. **Paragraphs** - Proper spacing between paragraphs
4. **Bulleted Lists** - Clean bullet points

## Files Created

### 1. `/src/components/EnhancedTextChat.tsx`
- Enhanced version of TextChat with markdown formatting
- Handles numbered lists, bold text, and paragraphs
- Drop-in replacement for TextChat

### 2. `/src/styles/formatted-chat.css`
- CSS styles for formatted messages
- Import this in your main CSS file

### 3. `/src/lib/format-message.tsx`
- Utility function for message formatting
- Can be used inline in components

## Usage

### Option 1: Replace TextChat with EnhancedTextChat

In `TextChatInterface.tsx`:
```typescript
// Replace this import:
import { TextChat } from './TextChat'

// With this:
import { EnhancedTextChat } from './EnhancedTextChat'

// Then replace the component usage:
<EnhancedTextChat 
  messages={chatMessages} 
  isTyping={isTyping}
  className="flex-1"
/>
```

### Option 2: Add CSS classes to existing TextChat

Add this to your TextChat component's message display:

```typescript
<div className="formatted-agent-message">
  {message.content}
</div>
```

And import the CSS in your main CSS file:
```css
@import './styles/formatted-chat.css';
```

## Example Output
Instead of:
```
For Duke Energy, the following work hours qualify as overtime: 1. **Sunday Work**: All hours worked on Sunday are considered overtime (100%), regardless of the time of day. 2. **Outside Core Hours**: Any work performed before 6:00 AM or after 6:00 PM is classified as overtime.
```

You'll get:
```

3. **Weekly Overtime**: Hours exceeding 40 in a week are considered overtime.
```

## Test Coverage
Both components include comprehensive test files to ensure proper functionality.
